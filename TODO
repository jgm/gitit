_ diffs don't work for pages that have been deleted

_ from index page, try clicking "upload" when you have to login -
  you won't be returned to the upload page.
  Perhaps we should address this by dispatching _upload, etc. on the page rather
  than using "dir _".

_ add a drag and drop interface to the index -- when you drag a file onto
  a folder, it will 'git mv' the file into that folder.  Also perhaps add
  a "Create folder" button?  Or would git-ls-tree ignore it without a file
  inside?

_ perhaps search should not use the "whole word" feature...
