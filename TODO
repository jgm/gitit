- add:  popular pages?  pages last visited?

- add "related changes" to history page (like activity, but looks at
  only pages linked from this one)

- page for users to recover password (by getting an email), change email address,
  change password.

- paging for long histories, activity lists

- handle logging: see http://groups.google.com/group/HAppS/browse_thread/thread/2b412f24c53f5aa/4ef39b57c6062a87?lnk=gst&q=logging#4ef39b57c6062a87

- add literate haskell support to pandoc, and to gitit

- does debugFilter still work?

- redo password salting.  see the post on happs google group about this.  a salt
  should be different for every user, and stored unhashed with the hash, not
  something stored in config.  unfortunately this will mean changing the gitusers
  file format again!  provide a short program to migrate.

- rss feed for all page changes?  see the rss library (Text.RSS) on HackageDB

- add signature? (-- ~~~~)

- diff with to but not from should use git-log -p

- links in activity should go directory to diff/to.

- need some way of indicating that a file is lhs... perhaps a leading <!-- lhs -->?

- improve use of string templates:  different components of pages should
  have their own templates.
