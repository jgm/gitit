- look at Wikipedia for formatting ideas:

  - page names:  change spaces to underscores
  - change wikilink generator so that the underscores are inserted
  - add talk pages
  - use tabs for edit, history, discuss, etc.
  - left sidebar:  search, export, upload, activity, index, help, front, etc.
  - add:  random page?  popular pages?  pages last visited?
  - banner picture is just upper-left corner
  - login/register on top right
  - add print css
  - add "permanent link" (link to this revision)
  - add "related changes" to history page (like activity, but looks at
    only pages linked from this one)
  - store email with user info, and provide a lost password email
  - paging for long histories, activity lists

- add literate haskell support to pandoc, and to gitit

- a pandoc change:  table of contents should come right before
  the first header, after any introductory text.

- smoother way to migrate when state format is changed?
  one approach would be to save user information in a file.
  so if you restarted, session info would be lost, but nothing
  important.
