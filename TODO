_ config should include functions for loginUserForm and
  a function to render the page.  templates stuff optional.

  default page rendering function can be generated by a
  function-generating function that reads the templates.
  then we don't need to store the templates in wiki state,
  instead we store the function.

_ consider making the library independent of datafiles, moving
  all of that to a separate gitit executable package?

_ consider replacing Params with a bunch of newtypes, one for
  each sort of param.  This would make the code more modular.

_ split config into a gitit-wide config, which is part of GititState,
  and a wiki-specific config

_ document HTTP auth setup in README
_ add "logout" link for HTTP auth?  This could have the server
  return an HTTP 401 (unauthorized), which should force the browser
  to ask for credentials...

_ rss feed for individual page changes & Recent Activity?  
  see the rss library (Text.RSS) on HackageDB.  see gwern's partial patch.

_ improve support for categories:
  _ categories in a tree structure
  _ editable category pages
  _ improve look of category box at bottom of page?
  see greenrd's email, also:
  an example of a category:
  http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Category:XMonad
  Note the subcategories as well. For general technical information 
  and usage of MediaWiki categories, see
  https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Help:Category &
  https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorization
  Categories can form a tree structure.
  Articles can be in multiple categories.

_ paging for long histories, activity lists

_ stabilize API

_ cleanup code for 80 cols; hlint

_ web page with simple instructions on installing gitit with
  cabal install and Haskell platform.

_ release!
