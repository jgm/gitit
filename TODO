x change how static files are served: rather than having
  a dedicated /_static/ path, use a fall-through method:
  a request to /foo/bar first checks for a static file
  foo/bar; if not found, we go on to other handlers. This
  would allow you to have /robots.txt and favicon.ico
  at root, add custom static HTML pages, etc..

x see proposal on mailing list about fall-through to
  data directory for static files and templates. This wd
  require some rearranging of data directory.  perhaps we
  need a static/ dir.

x do same for templates

_ get rid of googlecode page/ move issues to github??

_ while we're at it, we cd do the same thing with cached files,
  using a staticHandler to serve them and then falling back.
  We'd need to change the names (no .page extension), and we'd
  need to add the text/html mime type manually.

_ get wiki up to speed as main home page (demogitit).
  Add good Installing page.  Up-to-date User's Guide.
  Front page should list features and link to good demos.

_ think about making texmath a built-in option for displaying
  math, perhaps the default.

................................................................

_ use addSubgroup or mergeSTGroups to let templates in templates/
  dir "shadow" those in the data/templates dir.  THis way users
  don't have to manually merge changes to templates they haven't
  modified. But this would need good documentation.

_ consider making the library independent of datafiles, moving
  all of that to a separate gitit executable package?

_ consider replacing Params with a bunch of newtypes, one for
  each sort of param.  This would make the code more modular.

_ document HTTP auth setup in README

_ improve support for categories:
  _ categories in a tree structure
  _ editable category pages
  x improve look of category box at bottom of page?
  see greenrd's email, also:
  an example of a category:
  http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Category:XMonad
  Note the subcategories as well. For general technical information 
  and usage of MediaWiki categories, see
  https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Help:Category &
  https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorization
  Categories can form a tree structure.
  Articles can be in multiple categories.

_ paging for long histories, activity lists

_ stabilize API

_ cleanup code for 80 cols; hlint

_ web page with simple instructions on installing gitit with
  cabal install and Haskell platform.

_ release!
