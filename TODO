_ instead of CustomAuth, etc., have the Config include
  slots for handlers:  getLoggedInUser and loginUserForm.
  these can then get set appropriately depending on whether
  http-auth or form-auth is specified in the config file.
  and they can be overridden when using gitit as a library
  to use a custom auth system.  This should allow the
  functions getLoggedInUser and ifLoggedIn to be simplified.

_ consider making the library independent of datafiles, moving
  all of that to a separate gitit executable package?

_ consider replacing Params with a bunch of newtypes, one for
  each sort of param.  This would make the code more modular.

_ document HTTP auth setup in README
_ add "logout" link for HTTP auth?  This could have the server
  return an HTTP 401 (unauthorized), which should force the browser
  to ask for credentials...

_ rss feed for individual page changes & Recent Activity?  
  see the rss library (Text.RSS) on HackageDB.  see gwern's partial patch.

_ improve support for categories:
  _ categories in a tree structure
  _ editable category pages
  x improve look of category box at bottom of page?
  see greenrd's email, also:
  an example of a category:
  http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Category:XMonad
  Note the subcategories as well. For general technical information 
  and usage of MediaWiki categories, see
  https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Help:Category &
  https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorization
  Categories can form a tree structure.
  Articles can be in multiple categories.

_ paging for long histories, activity lists

_ stabilize API

_ cleanup code for 80 cols; hlint

_ web page with simple instructions on installing gitit with
  cabal install and Haskell platform.

_ release!
