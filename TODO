_ get rid of googlecode page/ move issues to github??

_ get wiki up to speed as main home page (demogitit).
  Add good Installing page.  Up-to-date User's Guide.
  Front page should list features and link to good demos.

_ document math options

................................................................

_ consider making the library independent of datafiles, moving
  all of that to a separate gitit executable package?

_ consider replacing Params with a bunch of newtypes, one for
  each sort of param.  This would make the code more modular.

_ document HTTP auth setup in README

_ improve support for categories:
  _ categories in a tree structure
  _ editable category pages
  x improve look of category box at bottom of page?
  see greenrd's email, also:
  an example of a category:
  http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Category:XMonad
  Note the subcategories as well. For general technical information 
  and usage of MediaWiki categories, see
  https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Help:Category &
  https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorization
  Categories can form a tree structure.
  Articles can be in multiple categories.

_ paging for long histories, activity lists

_ stabilize API

_ cleanup code for 80 cols; hlint

_ web page with simple instructions on installing gitit with
  cabal install and Haskell platform.

_ release!
