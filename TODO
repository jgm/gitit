- add talk pages

- add:  popular pages?  pages last visited?

- add "related changes" to history page (like activity, but looks at
  only pages linked from this one)

- recover lost email link?

- paging for long histories, activity lists

- handle logging: see http://groups.google.com/group/HAppS/browse_thread/thread/2b412f24c53f5aa/4ef39b57c6062a87?lnk=gst&q=logging#4ef39b57c6062a87

- ?? change wikilinks so that they are NOT relative (and change note
  in Help about relative links).  That is: insert a leading /
  in the URL.

- think about using a custom wikilink syntax, say {{Front Page}}.
  could implement this with generics and a function: [Inline] -> [Inline].

- add literate haskell support to pandoc, and to gitit

- does debugFilter still work?
