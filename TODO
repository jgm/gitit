_ document plugins in README (see old pandoc plugins docs)
_ add new type of plugin that is applied before updates and operates
  on raw source
_ add new type of plugin that transforms generated HTML
_ provide a way for a PageTransform plugin to tell gitit not to
  cache the page?

_ cleanup code for 80 cols; hlint

_ clean up architecture to take advantage of the new happstack
  architecture.
  get rid of Params; instead, use getter functions
  can also get rid of page parameter
  make everything a ServerPart monad
  take better advantage of happstack routing?

_ or, rewrite to use hack?  (if we can get a happstack backend)

----------

_ paging for long histories, activity lists

_ literate haskell support
  (By this is meant that the 'literate' part of the file should
  be interpreted and displayed as Markdown/ReST, and the code
  would be handled as it is now, inside delimited code blocks like
  ~~~~{.haskell}
  need some way of indicating that a file is lhs... perhaps a leading
  <!-- lhs -->?

_ rss feed for individual page changes & Recent Activity?  
  see the rss library (Text.RSS) on HackageDB.  see gwern's partial patch.

_ add signature? (-- ~~~~)  (pre-update plugin)

_ improve use of string templates:  different components of pages should
  have their own templates.

- add support for categories:
  an example of a category:
  http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Category:XMonad
  Note the subcategories as well. For general technical information 
  and usage of MediaWiki categories, see
  https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Help:Category &
  https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorization
  Categories can form a tree structure.
  Articles can be in multiple categories.
