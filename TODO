for release:

_ document (API haddock) for Gitit.Interface
_ document plugins in README

----------

_ Add a Go box that goes to the specified page title;
  if page does not exist, falls back to a normal search. Complements
  existing Search box.

- add:  popular pages?  pages last visited?

- add "related changes" to history page (like activity, but looks at
  only pages linked from this one)

- page for users to recover password (by getting an email), change email address,
  change password.

- paging for long histories, activity lists

- handle logging: see http://groups.google.com/group/HAppS/browse_thread/thread/2b412f24c53f5aa/4ef39b57c6062a87?lnk=gst&q=logging#4ef39b57c6062a87

- add literate haskell support to pandoc, and to gitit
  (By this is meant that the 'literate' part of the file should
  be interpreted and displayed as Markdown/ReST, and the code
  would be handled as it is now, inside delimited code blocks like
  ~~~~{.haskell}

- add haddock support to pandoc & gitit; this is much like literate haskell
  support, but in a sense the inverse as in literate haskell one marks the code
  and in haddock mode the 'literate' part is not merely all the comments but rather
  all the comments which are marked as being haddock (with '-- |' syntax).

- does debugFilter still work?

- rss feed for individual page changes & Recent Activity?  
  see the rss library (Text.RSS) on HackageDB

- add signature? (-- ~~~~)

- need some way of indicating that a file is lhs... perhaps a leading <!-- lhs -->?

- improve use of string templates:  different components of pages should
  have their own templates.
  see http://www.happstutorial.com/tutorial/stringtemplate-basics

- figure out how Pandoc plugins could be useful for gitit

- add support for categories:
  an example of a category:
  http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Category:XMonad
  Note the subcategories as well. For general technical information 
  and usage of MediaWiki categories, see
  https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Help:Category &
  https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorization
  Categories can form a tree structure.
  Articles can be in multiple categories.
