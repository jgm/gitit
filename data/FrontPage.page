# Welcome to Gitit!

Gitit is a wiki program written in Haskell. It uses [HAppS][] for the
web server and [pandoc][] for markup processing. Pages and uploaded
files are stored in a [git][] or [darcs][] repository and may be modified either
by using the VCS's command-line tools or through the wiki's web interface.
By default, pandoc's extended version of markdown is used as a markup language,
but reStructuredText can also be used.  Pages can be exported in a
number of different formats, including LaTeX, RTF, OpenOffice ODT, and
MediaWiki markup. Gitit can be configured to display TeX math (using
[jsMath][]) and highlighted source code (using [highlighting-kate][]).

You can edit this page by double-clicking on it, or by clicking on the
"edit" tab at the top of the screen.

You can make a link to another wiki page like this:
`[French Cheeses]()`.
This will produce a link like this:  [French Cheeses]().  Note that
the names of wiki pages need not be in CamelCase, and they may contain
spaces.  Wiki pages may be organized into directories.  Use the
slash ("/") character between directories and page names or
subdirectories: `[Wines/Pinot Noir]()`.

To create a new wiki page, just create a link to it and follow
the link.

Help is always available through the "Help" link in the sidebar.
