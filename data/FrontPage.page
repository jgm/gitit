# Welcome to Gitit!

Gitit is a [Wiki] written in [Haskell]. [HAppS] is used for the web
server and session state. Pages and uploaded files are stored in a [git]
repository and may be modified either by using git's command-line tools
or through the wiki's web interface. [Pandoc]'s extended version of
[markdown] is used as a markup language. Gitit can be configured to
display TeX math and highlighted source code.

You can edit this page by double-clicking on it, or by clicking on the
"edit" tab at the top of the screen.

You can make a link to another wiki page like this:
`[French Cheeses]()`.
This will produce a link like this:  [French Cheeses]().  Note that
the names of wiki pages need not be in CamelCase, and they may contain
spaces.  Wiki pages may be organized into directories.  Use the
slash ("/") character between directories and page names or
subdirectories: `[Wines/Pinot Noir]()`.

To create a new wiki page, just create a link to it and follow
the link.

Help is always available through the "Help" link in the sidebar.
