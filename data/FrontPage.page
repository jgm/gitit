# Welcome to Gitit!

Gitit is a wiki program written in Haskell. It uses [HAppS][] for the
web server and [pandoc][] for markup processing. Pages and uploaded
files are stored in a [git][] or [darcs][] repository and may be modified either
by using the VCS's command-line tools or through the wiki's web interface.
By default, pandoc's extended version of markdown is used as a markup language,
but reStructuredText, HTML, or LaTeX can also be used.  Pages can be exported in a
number of different formats, including LaTeX, RTF, OpenOffice ODT, and
MediaWiki markup. Gitit can be configured to display TeX math (using
[jsMath][]) and highlighted source code (using [highlighting-kate][]).

You can edit this page by double-clicking on it, or by clicking on the
"edit" tab at the top of the screen.

For instructions on how to make a link to another wiki page, see [the
Help page](/Help#wiki-links). To create a new wiki page, just create a
link to it and follow the link.

Help is always available through the "Help" link in the sidebar.
