# Markdown

This wiki's pages are written in [pandoc]'s extended form of [markdown].
If you're not familiar with markdown, you should start by looking
at the [markdown "basics" page] and the [markdown syntax description].
Consult the [pandoc User's Guide] for information about pandoc's syntax
for footnotes, tables, description lists, and other elements not present
in standard markdown.

Markdown is pretty intuitive, since it is based on email conventions.
Here are some examples to get you started:

code, it's because jsMath is

For headings, prefix a line with one or more `#` signs:  one for a major heading,
two for a subheading, three for a subsubheading.  Be sure to leave space before
and after the heading.

## Wiki links

Links to other wiki pages are formed this way:  `[Page Name]()`.
(Gitit converts markdown links with empty targets into wikilinks.)

To link to a wiki page using something else as the link text:
`[something else](Page Name)`.

Note that page names may contain spaces and some special characters.
They need not be CamelCase.  CamelCase words are *not* automatically
converted to wiki links.

Wiki pages may be organized into directories.  So, if you have
several pages on wine, you may wish to organize them like so:

    Wine/Pinot Noir
    Wine/Burgundy
    Wine/Cabernet Sauvignon

Note that a wiki link `[Burgundy]()` that occurs inside the `Wine`
directory will link to `Wine/Burgundy`, and not to `Burgundy`.
To link to a top-level page called `Burgundy`, you'd have to use
`[Burgundy](/Burgundy)`.

To link to a directory listing for a subdirectory, use a trailing
slash: `[Wine/]()` will link to a listing of the `Wine` subdirectory.
