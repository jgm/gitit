# Navigating

The most natural way of navigating is by clicking wiki links that
connect one page with another. The "Front page" link in the navigation
bar will always take you to the Front Page of the wiki. The "All pages"
link will take you to a list of all pages on the wiki (organized into
folders if directories are used). Alternatively, you can search using
the search box. Note that the search is set to look for whole words, so
if you are looking for "gremlins", type that and not "gremlin".
The "go" box will take you directly to the page you type.

# Creating and modifying pages

## Registering for an account

In order to modify pages, you'll need to be logged in.  To register
for an account, just click the "register" button in the bar on top
of the screen.  You'll be asked to choose a username and a password,
which you can use to log in in the future by clicking the "login"
button.  While you are logged in, these buttons are replaced by
a "logout so-and-so" button, which you should click to log out
when you are finished.

Note that logins are persistent through session cookies, so if you
don't log out, you'll still be logged in when you return to the
wiki from the same browser in the future.

## Editing a page

To edit a page, just double-click it, or click the "edit" button at
the bottom right corner of the page.

You can click "Preview" at any time to see how your changes will look.
Nothing is saved until you press "Save."

Note that you must provide a description of your changes.  This is to
make it easier for others to see how a wiki page has been changed.

## Creating a new page

To create a new page, just create a wiki link that links to it, and
click the link.  If the page does not exist, you will be editing it
immediately.

## Reverting to an earlier version

If you click the "history" button at the bottom of the page, you will
get a record of previous versions of the page.  You can see the differences
between two versions by dragging one onto the other; additions will be
highlighted in yellow, and deletions will be crossed out with a horizontal
line.  Clicking on the description of changes will take you to the page
as it existed after those changes.  To revert the page to the revision
you're currently looking at, just click the "revert" button at the bottom
of the page, then "Save". 

## Deleting a page

The "delete" button at the bottom of the page will delete a page.  Note
that deleted pages can be recovered, since a record of them will still be
accessible via the "activity" button on the top of the page.

# Uploading files

To upload a file--a picture, a PDF, or some other resource--click the
"upload" button in the navigation bar.  You will be prompted to select
the file to upload.  As with edits, you will be asked to provide a
description of the resource (or of the change, if you are overwriting
an existing file).

Often you may leave "Name on wiki" blank, since the existing name of the
file will be used by default.  If that isn't desired, supply a name.
Note that uploaded files *must* include a file extension (e.g. `.pdf`).

If you are providing a new version of a file that already exists on the
wiki, check the box "Overwrite existing file." Otherwise, leave it
unchecked.

To link to an uploaded file, just use its name in a regular wiki link.
For example, if you uploaded a picture `fido.jpg`, you can insert the
picture into a (markdown-formatted) page as follows: `![fido](fido.jpg)`.
If you uploaded a PDF `projection.pdf`, you can insert a link to it
using:  `[projection](projection.pdf)`.
