# Markup

The syntax for wiki pages is standard XHTML. All tags must be
properly closed.

## Wiki links

Links to other wiki pages are formed this way:
`<a href="">Page Name</a>`. (Gitit converts links with empty
targets into wikilinks.)

To link to a wiki page using something else as the link text:
`<a href="Page+Name">something else</a>`.

Note that page names may contain spaces and some special
characters. They need not be CamelCase. CamelCase words are *not*
automatically converted to wiki links.

Wiki pages may be organized into directories. So, if you have
several pages on wine, you may wish to organize them like so:

    Wine/Pinot Noir
    Wine/Burgundy
    Wine/Cabernet Sauvignon

Note that a wiki link `<a href="">Burgundy</a>` that occurs inside
the `Wine` directory will link to `Wine/Burgundy`, and not to
`Burgundy`. To link to a top-level page called `Burgundy`, you'd
have to use `<a href="/Burgundy">Burgundy</a>`.

To link to a directory listing for a subdirectory, use a trailing
slash:  `<a href="">Wine/</a>` will link to a listing of the `Wine` subdirectory.
