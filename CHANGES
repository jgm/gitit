Version 0.7.3 released 20 Mar 2010

* Added PDF export option and pdf-export config field.
  (Based on a patch by gwern.)

* Added markdown export.
    
* Improved multi-wiki example code in haddocks.

* Added session-timeout config setting.

* Config module:  Added readSize (recognizing K,M,G suffix).
  Previously readNumber always recognized K,M,G suffixes,
  but these only make sense in some contexts (not e.g. for
  times).

* Added Subst plugin (thanks to gwern).

* Added notes on PDF caching and idle.

* Fixed table of contents in wiki pages (resolving Issue #91).

* Added pandoc-user-data config option, allowing the user
  to specify a directory with e.g. templates that override
  the defaults used for exported pages.
    
* Fix filesToClean GHC panic when loading plugins on GHC HEAD

* Fixed problem with doubled // in updir links.
  Resolves Issue #88.

* Updated interwiki plugin.

* Fixed caching for feeds. Thanks to brian.sniffen for pointing
  out the need to normalize the time diff. Resolves Issue #87.

* Improved Feed module (gwern).

* Use line anchors from highlighting-source, so that you can link
  directly to a particular line in a source file.

* Disable upload functionality if maxUploadSize is 0.

* Exported queryGititState, updateGititState, Network.Gitit.Layout.
  Exported filledPageTemplate. (Thanks to tphyahoo.)
  Split off and expose createDefaultPages.
  Exposed compilePageTemplate.

* Use charset=utf-8 on output from Layout.

* Use isUnescapedInURI with escapeURIString rather than isAllowedInURI.
  The latter does not escape % signs.

Version 0.7.2 released 02 Jan 2010

* Now compiles with GHC 6.12.

Version 0.7.1 released 02 Jan 2010

* Updated exports to work with pandoc 1.4.

* Began updating to work with GHC 6.12. (Still untested; there may
  be further issues involving filestore.)

Version 0.7 released 20 Dec 2009

* Updated cabal file to allow happstack 0.4.

* Added support for the new mercurial filestore backend.
  (Depending on filestore >= 0.3.4.)

* Depend on xml >= 1.3.5.  This fixes a bug in the display of
  mathml.  Previously the self-closed tags in matrices with empty
  cells confused browsers and caused them to construct the
  DOM incorrectly. The problem is fixed by using xml's new
  ppcElement function to render the MathML without self-closed tags.

* Depend on pandoc >= 1.3.

* Properly handle UTF-8 in config files.

* Moved option parsing code from Config module to main program.
  The Config module now exports getConfigFromFile instead of
  getConfigFromOpts. This should be more useful for those using gitit as
  a library.

* Use wikiTitle config field in default HTML title.

* Improved search results:
  + Highlight search terms in search results.
    Partially resolves Issue #76.
  + Made search results message uniform when no results.
  + Search: don't match page name against empty patterns.
  + Allow search matches on subdirectory part of page name.
  + Search:  catch error status from filestore search.
    Filestore <= 0.3.3 does not properly handle the error status
    returned by later versions of 'git grep' when no match is found.
    The problem has been fixed in darcs filestore.

* CSS tweaks:
  + Removed base-min.css, folded necessary styles into screen.css.
  + Removed 'text-align: left' for th from CSS reset.

* Feed improvements:
  + Modified feed handling so that feeds validate.
  + Perform proper escaping in Feed.hs (thanks to gwern).
  + Don't reveal author email in feeds.
  + Sitewide feed is /_feed/ (with trailing slash).
  + Add "http://" to base-url config option if needed.

* Use + for spaces in URLs linking to wiki pages and folders.

* Updated plugins:
  + Updated Interwiki plugin (gwern).
  + Modified WebArchiver plugin to make Alexa requests (gwern).

Version 0.6.6 released 06 Nov 2009

* Require filestore >= 0.3.3, which closes a security
  vulnerability.

* Don't allow web file uploads to the static or templates directory,
  even if these are subdirectories of the repository directory.
  We don't want users uploading new CSS, javascript, or templates
  that might break the site.

* Renamed gitit-dog.png -> logo.png in data/static/img.
  This way the logo will show up even without a local img directory.
  Thanks to Thomas Hartmann for the patch.

* Return 404 when page not found.  Thanks to Richard Fergie.

* Improved layout of Export button.

* Added links for atom feeds to sitenav.st and pagetools.st, to
  make the feeds more discoverable.

* Minor code safety improvements.

* Check for commit messages consisting of whitespace.
  Commit messages consisting only of whitespace characters are
  rejected by Git as empty. Gitit should behave similarly.

* Allow gitit to start up if custom template directory not found.
  Thanks to Thomas Hartmann.

* Fixed incorrect usage of nullGroup (a debugging function).  Thanks
  to Thomas Hartmann.

Version 0.6.5 released 06 Oct 2009

* Added metadata to Page and Context, provided askMeta for plugins.
  This patch gives plugins access to all of the key/value pairs
  in the page metadata block.  Thanks to Dan Cook.

* Added PigLatin plugin to demonstrate use of askMeta.

* Display informative message on authentication failure.

* Fixed library stanza in cabal file so plugins are properly enabled.

Version 0.6.4 released 28 Sep 2009

* Fixed preview javascript so that tex math works properly in
  preview.

Version 0.6.3 released 27 Sep 2009

* Fixed MathML conversion so it doesn't happen when exporting to
  non-HTML output formats.

* Fixed shadowing on page templates: previously page.st was always
  taken from the defaults, even if a modified version existed
  in templates/.

* Modified YUI CSS reset so that ordered list enumerators can be
  styled properly.

* Modified showPage to work with both POST and GET requests.

Version 0.6.2 released 25 Aug 2009

* Use "reference obfuscation" for emails, rather than javascript
  obfuscation, which seems to interfere with preview.  Resolves
  Issue #59.

Version 0.6.1 released 25 Aug 2009

Instructions for upgrading from 0.5.3:

- If you were using a Haskell configuration file, you will
  need to create a new configuration file. 'gitit --print-default-config'
  will print a self-documenting default configuration file in the new
  format, which you can modify.

- If your wiki contains discuss pages of the form 'foo:discuss.page',
  rename them to '@foo.page'.

- Delete template.html and the static directory so that these will
  be replaced by the newest versions when you run gitit. If you have
  customized these, you should back them up first, then merge your
  changes into the new versions after they are created. (Note that
  template.html will be replaced by a templates/ directory.)

Summary of main changes:

* Added support for plugins -- dynamically loaded Haskell programs that
  transform pages. See the haddock documentation for Gitit.Interface for
  plugin documentation. The plugins directory contains several sample
  plugins.

* Gitit's configuration file is now a text file with key-value pairs,
  rather than a Haskell file.  The default configuration file
  (which can be printed using `gitit --print-default-config`
  contains comments that document all of the options.

* Pages may now be written in (limited dialects of) LaTeX or HTML,
  as well as markdown and reStructuredText.  The default format
  is determined by a configuration option, but can be overridden
  on a per-page basis using metadata (see below).  The default
  Front Page and Help page are created in the default format specified
  by the configuration file. In addition, syntax help is now displayed
  to the left of the editing box when a page is being edited.

* Pages may be written in literate Haskell, using either bird
  style with markdown or reStructuredText, or LaTeX style with
  LaTeX.  Literate Haskell can be made the default or specified on
  a per-page basis.

* Gitit now exports a library, Network.Gitit, that makes it easy for
  any happstack application to embed a gitit wiki.

* Added optional atom feeds, for whole site (at /_feed)
  and for individual pages (at /_feed/path/to/page).
  Feeds are cached with a configurable expiration time.

* Completely new caching system.  Caching is turned off by default and
  can be enabled by a configuration option.  Complete pages are cached
  on disk and expired when pages are revised through the web interface.
  When pages are modified directly through a VCS, the cache must be
  refreshed manually, either by pressing Ctrl-R while viewing a page,
  or by sending an HTTP request to /_expire/path/to/page, or by using
  the included program expireGititPath. The new system is much faster
  than the old in-memory cache, because it avoids the considerable
  overhead of filestore calls to get the current revision id.

* To make whole-page caching possible, the user login/out box has been
  made into an ajax request to /_user.  jQuery is now loaded on every
  page.

* Math is converted to MathML by default (using the texmath library),
  and a javascript is linked in that renders it correctly in IE+mathplayer,
  Firefox, and Opera.  The 'math' configuration setting can alternatively
  be set to 'jsMath' (to use jsMath javascript, which is more portable
  but ugly and slower) or 'raw' (plain LaTeX code).

* Routing changes for better handling of web spiders.  Instead of
  "/foo?history" we now have "/_history/foo"; instead of "/foo?edit"
  we haev "/_edit/foo"; etc.  This makes it possible to exclude web
  spiders from non-cached pages by excluding URLs that start with
  '/_'.  A default robots.txt file is now provided.  Users need not
  do anything special for this to be enabled.

* The authentication system has been revised and made much more
  flexible. In the configuration file, you can specify either
  'form', 'http', or 'generic' as authentication-method. Form
  authentication is the old form-based gitit authentication system. HTTP
  authentication presupposes that the wiki pages are locked down under
  HTTP authentication; the gitit user will be set to the username used
  for HTTP authentication. Generic authentication takes the username
  from the REMOTE_USER request header. When gitit is being used as a
  library, one can specify a custom withUser filter (which determines
  the logged in user and sets REMOTE_USER accordingly) and a custom
  authHandler (including handlers for /_login, /_logout, and whatever
  else is needed).

* Security fix: Gitit did not verify that a change password request
  is genuine when it receives the final POST. It has been changed to
  re-verify the reset code, otherwise an attacker could simply steal
  anyone's account by spoofing a POST request. (Thanks to Robin Green.)

* template.html has now been replaced by a directory, templates/, with
  separate templates for each component of a page.

* Added /_reloadTemplates action that recompiles the templates. (By
  default the templates are compiled only on startup.)

* Gitit's form-based authentication now includes a "password reset"
  email.  Slightly modified from a patch from Henry Laxen.

* The naming scheme for discussion pages has changed: the discussion
  page for foo is now @foo, not foo:discuss. Reason: Windows, and
  thus darcs, does not like colons in filenames.

* Improved logging, with configurable verbosity.

* Major code reorganization and cleanup.  Gitit has been moved under
  the Network namespace. The old WebT handlers are replaced by new ones
  in ServerPartT. 'handle' has been removed; instead, we use happstack's
  routing combinators. Configuration and filestores are now passed
  around in a reader monad, in WikiState. (This also allows different
  wikis to have different configurations.) Most handlers have been
  simplified so that they no longer require Page and Params arguments.
  A new function, 'withInput', is used to avoid the need to pass Params
  between handlers.

* The static handler now "falls back" to the cabal data directory if the
  requested file is not in "static" (or staticDir).  So the user need
  no longer have a copy of the standard gitit CSS, javascript, and
  image files in "static" (unless these are to be overridden). This
  should make updates easier.  By default only 'custom.css' and
  'logo.png' are put in the user's static directory.

* Similarly, the templates in "templates" "fall back" to defaults in
  the cabal data directory.  By default only 'footer.st' is put in
  the user's static directory.

* Gitit State now includes a renderPage function. This is more flexible
  than storing a page template, since the user may want to use a custom
  page rendering function, even one not based on string templates.

* Added Network.Gitit.ContentTransformer module (thanks to Anton van
  Straaten). The ContentTransformer module replaces Gitit.Convert. It
  defines a number of single-purpose combinators that can be combined to
  yield various kinds of content conversions. These are used to define
  showPage, preview, showHighlightedSource, and other handlers that used
  to be defined in Gitit.hs.

* Verify in delete POST requests that filetodelete parameter matches
  page.

* Fixed revert when called from diff pages. Revert now reverts to the
  older of the two revisions being compared.

* Revamped auto-merging: user must now verify an edited page after
  a merge, even if there were no conflicts.

* Fixed Content-Disposition header on export so that filenames have
  proper extensions.

* Updated for happstack-server-0.3.3.  Since this version of happstack
  supports UTF-8, gitit's old manual decoding and encoding were removed.

* Use fileServeStrict instead of fileServe.  Resolves Issue #57.

* 'limit' is no longer used in search.  The way it worked before was
  confusing, since it limited total matches (usually to just a few files)
  rather than limiting the number of matches in each file.

* rdgreen's cautious-file library is now used to write the gitit-users
  file. This makes it less likely that the file will be corrupted on
  a power outage or hardware failure.

* Redirects set properly after account creation.  If users go from
  the Login form to the Register form, they are no longer redirected
  back to the Login form after creating an account.

* indexPage now uses filestore's new 'directory' function. It shows one
  directory at a time. Subdirectories link to further index pages. This
  improves on the old javascript folding interface, which did not preserve
  state.  (Thanks to Thomas Hartman for suggestions.)

* URLs of the form /a/b/ are now equivalent to /_index/a/b.

* Improvements and bug fixes to deleting. Deleting a non-page now works.
  You get a nice informative message if you try to delete a nonexistent
  page or file.

* Page names containing "..", "?", or "*", and '_' at beginning are
  disallowed. Page names may now contain periods.

* The "Permanent link" link has been removed. It relied on the sha1
  parameter always being set, but we've changed that for performance
  reasons.

* Gitit can now be proxied to a subdirectory path. Thanks to Henry Laxen
  for the idea and patches. See README for instructions.

* Performance improvements (mostly due to Gwern Branwen):  Pages can be
  compressed (configurable); unneeded filestore calls removed; cache-control:
  max-age used.

* Moved sidebar to end of HTML to make things easier for screen readers.

* Moved search box and go box to templates.

* Yahoo YUI CSS framework is now used for better consistency across browsers.
  CSS cleaned up.  Icons for page types removed.

* Fixed handling of 'forUser' parameter in 'recent activity'.

* Made default maxUploadSize 10 Mb.

* Renamed AppState -> GititState.

Version 0.5.3 released 1 Feb 2009

* Fixed bug which caused jsMath not to load.

Version 0.5.2 released 1 Feb 2009

* Fixed cookie problem caused by empty value fields.

Version 0.5.1 released 1 Feb 2009

* Major code reorganization, making gitit more modular.

* Gitit can now optionally be built using Happstack instead of HAppS
  (just use -fhappstack when cabal installing).

* Fixed bug with directories that had the same names as pages.

* Added code from HAppS-Extra to fix cookie parsing problems.

* New command-line options for --port, --debug.

* New debug feature prints the date, the raw request, and
  the processed request data to standard output on each request.

* Files with ".page" extension can no longer be uploaded.

* Apostrophes and quotation marks now allowed in page names.
