  * Allow newer versions of dependencies.

Version 0.10.5 released 23 August 2014

  * Added github login option (Freiric Barral).

  * Change default math display to mathjax.

  * Relaxed package bounds, fixed compiler warnings.
    Added Network.Gitit.Compat.Except module for compatibility
    with earlier and later mtl versions.

  * Added network-uri flag to accommodate network-uri/network split.

  * Fixed failure when loading the Subst plugin (Glenn Searby).

  * Added Makefile, for use in installing on server.

  * Corrected MathJax CDN URL (Maciek Makowski).

Version 0.10.4 released 30 Jun 2014

*   Updated package bounds for happstack (#382), pandoc, blaze-html,
    network.

*   Display EPS as image, not code.

*   Fixed recent activity page for binary files (Sergey Koposov).

*   Use normal spaces instead of nbsp in activity page (Sergey Koposov).

*   Display a delete link next to uploads in file list (rekado).

*   Change _search to use HTTP GET, so searches can be linked
    and refreshed (Joe Hillenbrand).

*   Document mod_proxy_html setting in README.  Added a mod_proxy_html
    configuration directive to insert a DOCTYPE string (Johann Visagie).

*   Added new template variables `isdiscusspage`, `isarticleUrl`,
    `discussionUrl`.  This makes it possible to treat discussion pages
    specially in templates, and insert appropriate links (Shane O'Brien).

*   Added template variables `articlename`, `discussionname`,
    `isarticlepage` (Shane O'Brien).

*   Added redirects (#233).  You can now create a redirect page by adding
    a `redirect` field to the metadata of a page (Shane O'Brien).

    - When a user visits a redirect page, they are redirected to the
      destination page.
    - At the destination page, a message is displayed telling the user
      that they have been redirected from the source page. A link is
      provided back to the source page, with a parameter to disable the
      redirect (so that it can be edited).
    - Gitit will detects circular redirects and explain to the user
      what is going on in such cases.

*   Added "search for pages containing..." option to `createPage`.
    Changed "page not found" page to give the option of searching for
    the page name or creating a page with that name (Shane O'Brien).

*   Set `pgTitle` in `showDiff` (Shane O'Brien).

*   Made the default "since" for the activity page configurable
    (Shane O'Brien).

*   Only set the `tabs` template variable if there are tabs (Shane O'Brien).

*   Removed access question from password reset form. It's only
    needed for the register form (Shane O'Brien).

*   Added `for` attribute to all labels on forms (Shane O'Brien).

*   Updated `pageToString` to use new metadata format (Shane O'Brien).

*   Handlers: Fixed duplicate function defn for `fileAnchor`.

*   Added `Org` and `BocBook` to `PageType` (API change).  Pages
    may now be written in Ord mode or DocBook syntax.

*   Allow multiple categories, separated by commas,
    in a `_category` URL (Caleb McDaniel).  The pages in all listed
    categories will be returned.

*   Added filter links for `_category` pages (Cabel McDaniel).

*   Fixed image exports in Docx, RTF, slides, PDF (#399, #353).

*   Restored inline syntax highlighting.

*   Fixed highlighting in exports (#356).

*   Added `ICML` and `beamer` as export formats (#391).

*   Added github-style backgrounds to code blocks (Joe Hillenbrand).

*   Lighter heading border (like wikimedia) (Joe Hillenbrand).

*   Fixed links on activity page (Shane O'Brien).

*   Added markup help for Textile, Org, DocBook (#434).

*   Modified plugins/Subst.hs to work with latest pandoc (Tianyi Cui).

*   Fixed wiki links when `base-url` is empty and `absolute-urls` yes
    (Tianyi Cui).

*   README:  document that changes to templates require a restart (Raphael).


Version 0.10.3.1 released 19 Mar 2013

*   Fixed filename encoding problem affecting caching,
    for gitit compiled with GHC 7.4 or later.

*   Fixed padding on some buttons (akerbos).

*   Specify correct format in header for initial pages (benmachine).

Version 0.10.3 released 09 Mar 2013

*   Allow latest versions of pandoc, blaze-html, HStringTemplate.

*   Fixed duplicate ids in user box.

*   Added `mathjax-script` option, specifies the mathjax script to
    use. (Dmitry Gerasimov.)

*   Set focus on editedText on page load.  (Mathieu Larose.)

*   Added `address` config option.  (Matieu Larose.)

Version 0.10.2 released 09 Feb 2013

*   Updated to work with pandoc 1.10.

*   Fixed path for MathMLInHTML.js script.  Closes #345.
    Thanks to tstgruby.

*   Updated interwiki plugin (gwern).

*   Made it possible to export pages with images stored in the
    repository itself (as opposed to the static directory).  Thanks
    to Claudio Bley for the patch.

Version 0.10.1.2 released 11 Jan 2013

*   Fixed regression in option parsing.  An earlier patch
    caused the '-f' option not to work.  Closes #336.

Version 0.10.1.1 released 01 Jan 2013

*   Allow compilation with directory < 1.2.

Version 0.10.1 released 31 Dec 2012

*   Fixed duplicate dropExtension on categoryPage.  (atsuo yamada)
    This created problems with categories containing periods.

*   Fixed duplicate unescaping of HTML entities. (atsuo yamada)

*   Supply $revision$ at _diff if "Changes from beginning to..."
    (atsuo yamada)

*   MathJax rendering is now working in edit preview mode
    (Dmitry Gerasimov).

*   Upgrade directory package dependency to 1.2, and
    fix compilation issue with GHC 7.6.1 (Bin Jin).

*   Allow metadata keys to include digits, _, -.  Closes #328.

*   Don't read config for --help or --version (Ben Millwood).
    Also involves a refactor of options into those that make the program
    quit immediately, and those that just alter the configuration.

*   Updated to use filestore 0.6 (new diff API).
    Thanks to markwright for partial patch.

*   Include format metadata in default installed pages.
    This allows them to continue working when the user changes the
    default page format.  Closes #329.

*   Added explicit path to Gitit User's Guide in default front page.

*   Fix Gitit User's Guide link on front page.
    Previously it was broken due to "smart punctuation."

*   Fixed validation messages.  Switched from using lookRead "messages"
    to using looks "message" for messages.  Closes #294.

Version 0.10.0.2 released 02 Nov 2012

*   Raised version bounds for dependencies.

*   Updated post-update script to use new forms of git commands.
    Closes #317.

*   Fixed withTempDir so it returns to old directory.
    Closes #303.  This is a slightly different solution than the one
    proposed by tstgruby, but it has the advantage that only withTempDir
    itself needs to be changed.

*   Added nginx example for proxy setup (README) (Andre Kelpe).

Version 0.10.0.1 released 07 Jun 2012

*   Fixed double-encoding bug for unicode page names
    (Alexander Vershilov).

*   Require happstack-server >= 7.

Version 0.10 released 30 May 2012

*   Changed 'readFileUTF8' so it doesn't encode filename on ghc 7.4.

*   Upgraded for compatibility with blaze-html 0.5.  Closes #299.

*   Improved categories. Files are now read strictly to avoid a 'too
    many open files' error. 'Page' now exports 'readCategories' instead of
    'extractCategories'.

*   Require filestore 0.5.  This brings in (a) correct handling
    of unicode paths when compiled under GHC 7.4, and (b) a 'limit'
    parameter for 'history'. The limit parameter is essential when
    gitit is used with very large repositories; otherwise history
    commands would have to parse the entire log.  Handler functions
    that use 'history' have been updated to use the optional
    'limit' parameter.

*   Atom feeds are now limited to 200 entries, to prevent server
    overload.

*   Indicate size of default logo picture in README. Closes #291.

*   Added a README section on restricting access.  Closes #292.

Version 0.9.0.1 released 15 Feb 2012

*   Fixed bug in fromEntities that caused text to be lost in the page
    source after semicolons.  Thanks to Perry Wagle for reporting the bug.

*   Updated code to run on happstack 7.

*   Removed dependency on happstack-util; depend on base64-bytestring
    instead.

*   Updated gitit.cabal to include footnotes.js (Ben Sinclair).

Version 0.9 released 29 Feb 2012

*   Gitit now uses the latest pandoc (1.9.x) and happstack-server (6.6.x),
    and compiles on ghc 7.4.1.

*   Added Docx, AsciiDoc, and DZSlides as export formats.

*   HTML slide show exports are now "self-contained":  they embed all
    required js, css, and images, so they can be used offline.

*   Allow spaces in usernames (Juraj Hercek).

*   Improve PDF/RTF exports containing images in the wiki.
    Wikidata paths are translated to absolute ones, so pandoc/pdflatex
    can find them (Juraj Hercek).

*   Protect against XSS in slide show exports.  Previous versions
    of gitit sanitized wikipages, but not HTML slide shows.

*   Table of contents is now in a div with ID `TOC`, so it can
    be styled.

*   Removed letter and word spacing from print.css.

*   Added s5 directory to static.  This is needed by pandoc 1.9.

*   Updated Interwiki plugin (gwern).

*   Added `fromEntities` to `Types`, since `decodeCharacterReferences`
    is no longer exported from Pandoc.  Added dependency on tagsoup.

*   Provided `FromReqURI` instance for `[String]`, since
    this is not automatic with recent happstack.

Version 0.8.1 released 02 Sep 2011

*   Support mathjax as a math option.
    Added MathJax as MathMethod, and mathjax as an option in
    the 'math' config field.  Resolves GoogleCode 122.

*   Added xss-sanitize configuaration option.
    Setting it to 'no' turns off sanitization, enabling
    file:// URLs and other things that get filtered out
    by xss-sanitize.

*   Listen interface explanation on help file could be more clear (#266)
    (andyring)

*   Add the new configuration option 'absolute-urls'.
    When turned on, this makes wikilinks absolute w.r.t. the base-url.
    By default, they are relative.  So, for example, in a wiki served
    at the path 'wiki', on a page Sub/Page, the wikilink '[Cactus]()'
    will produce a link to '/wiki/Cactus' if absolute-urls is on,
    and otherwise the relative link 'Cactus'.  Patch due to lemmih.

*   Change default listen address to 0.0.0.0.

*   Serve svg file as image, not source code!

*   Page history:  use 'limit' instead of restricting to past year.
    limit defaults to 100.  If 100 are displayed, you'll get a
    "Show more..." link that will increase the limit.
    Also fixed bug that caused a 404 when no history was returned.

*   Require pandoc >= 1.8.2.

*   Allow build with happstack-server 6.2.

*   Updated for use with xss-sanitize 0.3, which uses Text.
    New dependency on text.

Version 0.8.0.1 released 07 Jun 2011

* Fixed file upload problem with recent versions of directory
  package. (Thanks to Oliver Braun.)

* Relaxed some version upper bounds.

Version 0.8 released 13 May 2011

* Uses happstack 6.

* Added textile and org export formats, textile page format.

* Added support for RPXNow authentication, based on a patch from
  Pasqualino Titto Assini.

* Added `authentication-required` field in config.

    * If set to 'modify', authentication is required to modify the wiki.
    * If set to 'read', atuhentication is required to view the wiki.
    * If set to 'none', authentication is never required, and pages can
      be edited anonymously.

    API changes:

    * currentUser moved to Authentication module
    * requireAuthentication added to Config
    * Added AuthenticationLevel type
    * requireUser renamed authenticate, parameter for AuthenticationLevel
      added; requireUserThat renamed authenticateUserThat

* MathML and jsMath now work in the preview pane (Sean Seefried).

* Use footnotes.js for fancy footnote styling (gwern).

* Added a `--listen` parameter to specify the listen device
  (Timo B. Hübel).

* Removed withInput.

* Replaced fileContents with filePath in Params.

* Fixed bug in uploadForm.js which caused a prefix to be added in the
  default wikiname.


Version 0.7.3.12 released 01 Feb 2011

* Use pandoc 1.8.

* New export formats: textile, org.

* New page form: textile.

Version 0.7.3.11 released 28 Jan 2011

* Allow time 1.2.

Version 0.7.3.10 released 26 Jan 2011

* Updated for filestore-0.4.0.2.  Gitit should now compile with ghc 7.
  Note:  It may be necessary to supply the --disable-library-for-ghci
  flag to 'cabal install highlighting-kate'.

Version 0.7.3.9 released 25 Jan 2011

* Removed dependency on cautious-file.
  It no longer seems to be actively maintained, and the current
  configuration does not compile on windows.

* Removed dependency on datetime package.
  It is no longer maintained.
  Everything can be done just as well with the time package.

* Depend on filestore >= 0.4 (without datetime dependency).

* Bump version bounds on hslogger, network and HTTP.

* Support for GHC 7.0 in Plugins (thanks to Max Bollingbroke).

* Use xss-sanitize for sanitizing HTML.
  Previously pandoc's sanitization was used, but this will be
  removed in the next pandoc release. xss-sanitize is a more complete
  solution, and also prevents people from messing up layout by inserting
  unbalanced </div>.

* Updated Feed module to make it decouplable from gitit.

* jQuery.load wasn't working on Safari. Use jQuery.post instead.
  Also, the convert function was not always in scope. (It is only in
  scope when MathML is enabled?) We check if it is defined before
  calling it.  (Thanks to Sean Seefried.)

* Export Page module.

* Templates are in data directory

* Fixed bug in Subst plugin (Lars Petersen).
  Subst plugin could not deal with non-existing pages, resulting
  in an server error when trying to substitute with an absent file.
  This patch now creates a link to the page in order to create it.

* Added alt attribute to logo.

Version 0.7.3.8 released 24 July 2010

* Fixed MathML in Slidy and S5 exports.

* Use languagesByFilename instead of languagesByExtension in isSource.

Version 0.7.3.7 released 24 July 2010

* Depend on pandoc >= 1.6, highlighting-kate >= 0.2.7.1

* Added epub and slidy export formats.

* Require happstack >= 0.5.

* Added google math option (uses google charts api).
  Slightly modified from a patch by lpeterse.

* Made WebArchiver plugin more parallel (gwern).

* Fixed Dot plugin to work with GHC 6.12.
  We were having string encoding issues reading the output
  of dot with readProcess. Solution is to pass dot an output
  filename so we don't have to read its output.

Version 0.7.3.6 released 05 May 2010

* Fixed ODT/PDF export for files in subdirectories.  Resolves Issue #81.

* Fix image URLs before calling the ODT or PDF processors

* Added plain text export format.

* Raised upper bound for datetime, parsec, and happstack dependencies.

* Fix wikilinks to they don't get a leading slash.
  This reverts a bug introduced by 2128afb070b7, which added leading
  slashes to wikilinks, breaking them for people using gitit as a
  library on a path other than /.

Version 0.7.3.5 released 21 Mar 2010

* Returned to using pandoc's MathML writer option.
  This is fixed in pandoc 1.5.0.1. Depend on pandoc >= 1.5.0.1.

Version 0.7.3.4 released 21 Mar 2010

* Use custom readFileUTF8 (exported in Network.Gitit.Util) instead of
  broken System.IO.UTF8. This way we have a uniform solution for GHC
  6.10 and 6.12, and don't have to use CPP tricks. This change fixes
  categories on GHC 6.12. Resolves Issue #98.

Version 0.7.3.3 released 21 Mar 2010

* Reverted to handling math in MathML mode in the old way, using
  a transform, rather than relying on pandoc's MathML writer option.
  The latter was causing amazing CPU and memory usage, for reasons
  I don't yet understand.  This should fix the problem for now.

* Fixed caching for unicode page names.

* Added max-page-size config option. Thanks to Jinjing Wang for the patch.

* Prevented _expire/ from failing if the page is not cached.

* Fixed URL encoding for pages. (Note: Don't use + for spaces;
  that breaks the Ctrl-R cache expiration.)

Version 0.7.3.2 released 20 Mar 2010

* Fixed editing of pages when max-upload-size=0.
  max-upload-size should not double as max-page-size.
  Resolves Issue #96.

Version 0.7.3.1 released 20 Mar 2010

* Changed "In" to "in" in MathMLinJS.js link.

Version 0.7.3 released 20 Mar 2010

* Added PDF export option and pdf-export config field.
  (Based on a patch by gwern.)

* Added markdown export.

* Use pandoc's new MathML math mode for more efficient
  MathML.

* Improved multi-wiki example code in haddocks.

* Added session-timeout config setting.

* Config module:  Added readSize (recognizing K,M,G suffix).
  Previously readNumber always recognized K,M,G suffixes,
  but these only make sense in some contexts (not e.g. for
  times).

* Added Subst plugin (thanks to gwern).

* Added notes on PDF caching and idle.

* Fixed table of contents in wiki pages (resolving Issue #91).

* Added pandoc-user-data config option, allowing the user
  to specify a directory with e.g. templates that override
  the defaults used for exported pages.

* Fix filesToClean GHC panic when loading plugins on GHC HEAD

* Fixed problem with doubled // in updir links.
  Resolves Issue #88.

* Updated interwiki plugin.

* Fixed caching for feeds. Thanks to brian.sniffen for pointing
  out the need to normalize the time diff. Resolves Issue #87.

* Improved Feed module (gwern).

* Use line anchors from highlighting-source, so that you can link
  directly to a particular line in a source file.

* Disable upload functionality if maxUploadSize is 0.

* Exported queryGititState, updateGititState, Network.Gitit.Layout.
  Exported filledPageTemplate. (Thanks to tphyahoo.)
  Split off and expose createDefaultPages.
  Exposed compilePageTemplate.

* Use charset=utf-8 on output from Layout.

* Use isUnescapedInURI with escapeURIString rather than isAllowedInURI.
  The latter does not escape % signs.

Version 0.7.2 released 02 Jan 2010

* Now compiles with GHC 6.12.

Version 0.7.1 released 02 Jan 2010

* Updated exports to work with pandoc 1.4.

* Began updating to work with GHC 6.12. (Still untested; there may
  be further issues involving filestore.)

Version 0.7 released 20 Dec 2009

* Updated cabal file to allow happstack 0.4.

* Added support for the new mercurial filestore backend.
  (Depending on filestore >= 0.3.4.)

* Depend on xml >= 1.3.5.  This fixes a bug in the display of
  mathml.  Previously the self-closed tags in matrices with empty
  cells confused browsers and caused them to construct the
  DOM incorrectly. The problem is fixed by using xml's new
  ppcElement function to render the MathML without self-closed tags.

* Depend on pandoc >= 1.3.

* Properly handle UTF-8 in config files.

* Moved option parsing code from Config module to main program.
  The Config module now exports getConfigFromFile instead of
  getConfigFromOpts. This should be more useful for those using gitit as
  a library.

* Use wikiTitle config field in default HTML title.

* Improved search results:
  + Highlight search terms in search results.
    Partially resolves Issue #76.
  + Made search results message uniform when no results.
  + Search: don't match page name against empty patterns.
  + Allow search matches on subdirectory part of page name.
  + Search:  catch error status from filestore search.
    Filestore <= 0.3.3 does not properly handle the error status
    returned by later versions of 'git grep' when no match is found.
    The problem has been fixed in darcs filestore.

* CSS tweaks:
  + Removed base-min.css, folded necessary styles into screen.css.
  + Removed 'text-align: left' for th from CSS reset.

* Feed improvements:
  + Modified feed handling so that feeds validate.
  + Perform proper escaping in Feed.hs (thanks to gwern).
  + Don't reveal author email in feeds.
  + Sitewide feed is /_feed/ (with trailing slash).
  + Add "http://" to base-url config option if needed.

* Use + for spaces in URLs linking to wiki pages and folders.

* Updated plugins:
  + Updated Interwiki plugin (gwern).
  + Modified WebArchiver plugin to make Alexa requests (gwern).

Version 0.6.6 released 06 Nov 2009

* Require filestore >= 0.3.3, which closes a security
  vulnerability.

* Don't allow web file uploads to the static or templates directory,
  even if these are subdirectories of the repository directory.
  We don't want users uploading new CSS, javascript, or templates
  that might break the site.

* Renamed gitit-dog.png -> logo.png in data/static/img.
  This way the logo will show up even without a local img directory.
  Thanks to Thomas Hartmann for the patch.

* Return 404 when page not found.  Thanks to Richard Fergie.

* Improved layout of Export button.

* Added links for atom feeds to sitenav.st and pagetools.st, to
  make the feeds more discoverable.

* Minor code safety improvements.

* Check for commit messages consisting of whitespace.
  Commit messages consisting only of whitespace characters are
  rejected by Git as empty. Gitit should behave similarly.

* Allow gitit to start up if custom template directory not found.
  Thanks to Thomas Hartmann.

* Fixed incorrect usage of nullGroup (a debugging function).  Thanks
  to Thomas Hartmann.

Version 0.6.5 released 06 Oct 2009

* Added metadata to Page and Context, provided askMeta for plugins.
  This patch gives plugins access to all of the key/value pairs
  in the page metadata block.  Thanks to Dan Cook.

* Added PigLatin plugin to demonstrate use of askMeta.

* Display informative message on authentication failure.

* Fixed library stanza in cabal file so plugins are properly enabled.

Version 0.6.4 released 28 Sep 2009

* Fixed preview javascript so that tex math works properly in
  preview.

Version 0.6.3 released 27 Sep 2009

* Fixed MathML conversion so it doesn't happen when exporting to
  non-HTML output formats.

* Fixed shadowing on page templates: previously page.st was always
  taken from the defaults, even if a modified version existed
  in templates/.

* Modified YUI CSS reset so that ordered list enumerators can be
  styled properly.

* Modified showPage to work with both POST and GET requests.

Version 0.6.2 released 25 Aug 2009

* Use "reference obfuscation" for emails, rather than javascript
  obfuscation, which seems to interfere with preview.  Resolves
  Issue #59.

Version 0.6.1 released 25 Aug 2009

Instructions for upgrading from 0.5.3:

- If you were using a Haskell configuration file, you will
  need to create a new configuration file. 'gitit --print-default-config'
  will print a self-documenting default configuration file in the new
  format, which you can modify.

- If your wiki contains discuss pages of the form 'foo:discuss.page',
  rename them to '@foo.page'.

- Delete template.html and the static directory so that these will
  be replaced by the newest versions when you run gitit. If you have
  customized these, you should back them up first, then merge your
  changes into the new versions after they are created. (Note that
  template.html will be replaced by a templates/ directory.)

Summary of main changes:

* Added support for plugins -- dynamically loaded Haskell programs that
  transform pages. See the haddock documentation for Gitit.Interface for
  plugin documentation. The plugins directory contains several sample
  plugins.

* Gitit's configuration file is now a text file with key-value pairs,
  rather than a Haskell file.  The default configuration file
  (which can be printed using `gitit --print-default-config`
  contains comments that document all of the options.

* Pages may now be written in (limited dialects of) LaTeX or HTML,
  as well as markdown and reStructuredText.  The default format
  is determined by a configuration option, but can be overridden
  on a per-page basis using metadata (see below).  The default
  Front Page and Help page are created in the default format specified
  by the configuration file. In addition, syntax help is now displayed
  to the left of the editing box when a page is being edited.

* Pages may be written in literate Haskell, using either bird
  style with markdown or reStructuredText, or LaTeX style with
  LaTeX.  Literate Haskell can be made the default or specified on
  a per-page basis.

* Gitit now exports a library, Network.Gitit, that makes it easy for
  any happstack application to embed a gitit wiki.

* Added optional atom feeds, for whole site (at /_feed)
  and for individual pages (at /_feed/path/to/page).
  Feeds are cached with a configurable expiration time.

* Completely new caching system.  Caching is turned off by default and
  can be enabled by a configuration option.  Complete pages are cached
  on disk and expired when pages are revised through the web interface.
  When pages are modified directly through a VCS, the cache must be
  refreshed manually, either by pressing Ctrl-R while viewing a page,
  or by sending an HTTP request to /_expire/path/to/page, or by using
  the included program expireGititPath. The new system is much faster
  than the old in-memory cache, because it avoids the considerable
  overhead of filestore calls to get the current revision id.

* To make whole-page caching possible, the user login/out box has been
  made into an ajax request to /_user.  jQuery is now loaded on every
  page.

* Math is converted to MathML by default (using the texmath library),
  and a javascript is linked in that renders it correctly in IE+mathplayer,
  Firefox, and Opera.  The 'math' configuration setting can alternatively
  be set to 'jsMath' (to use jsMath javascript, which is more portable
  but ugly and slower) or 'raw' (plain LaTeX code).

* Routing changes for better handling of web spiders.  Instead of
  "/foo?history" we now have "/_history/foo"; instead of "/foo?edit"
  we haev "/_edit/foo"; etc.  This makes it possible to exclude web
  spiders from non-cached pages by excluding URLs that start with
  '/_'.  A default robots.txt file is now provided.  Users need not
  do anything special for this to be enabled.

* The authentication system has been revised and made much more
  flexible. In the configuration file, you can specify either
  'form', 'http', or 'generic' as authentication-method. Form
  authentication is the old form-based gitit authentication system. HTTP
  authentication presupposes that the wiki pages are locked down under
  HTTP authentication; the gitit user will be set to the username used
  for HTTP authentication. Generic authentication takes the username
  from the REMOTE_USER request header. When gitit is being used as a
  library, one can specify a custom withUser filter (which determines
  the logged in user and sets REMOTE_USER accordingly) and a custom
  authHandler (including handlers for /_login, /_logout, and whatever
  else is needed).

* Security fix: Gitit did not verify that a change password request
  is genuine when it receives the final POST. It has been changed to
  re-verify the reset code, otherwise an attacker could simply steal
  anyone's account by spoofing a POST request. (Thanks to Robin Green.)

* template.html has now been replaced by a directory, templates/, with
  separate templates for each component of a page.

* Added /_reloadTemplates action that recompiles the templates. (By
  default the templates are compiled only on startup.)

* Gitit's form-based authentication now includes a "password reset"
  email.  Slightly modified from a patch from Henry Laxen.

* The naming scheme for discussion pages has changed: the discussion
  page for foo is now @foo, not foo:discuss. Reason: Windows, and
  thus darcs, does not like colons in filenames.

* Improved logging, with configurable verbosity.

* Major code reorganization and cleanup.  Gitit has been moved under
  the Network namespace. The old WebT handlers are replaced by new ones
  in ServerPartT. 'handle' has been removed; instead, we use happstack's
  routing combinators. Configuration and filestores are now passed
  around in a reader monad, in WikiState. (This also allows different
  wikis to have different configurations.) Most handlers have been
  simplified so that they no longer require Page and Params arguments.
  A new function, 'withInput', is used to avoid the need to pass Params
  between handlers.

* The static handler now "falls back" to the cabal data directory if the
  requested file is not in "static" (or staticDir).  So the user need
  no longer have a copy of the standard gitit CSS, javascript, and
  image files in "static" (unless these are to be overridden). This
  should make updates easier.  By default only 'custom.css' and
  'logo.png' are put in the user's static directory.

* Similarly, the templates in "templates" "fall back" to defaults in
  the cabal data directory.  By default only 'footer.st' is put in
  the user's static directory.

* Gitit State now includes a renderPage function. This is more flexible
  than storing a page template, since the user may want to use a custom
  page rendering function, even one not based on string templates.

* Added Network.Gitit.ContentTransformer module (thanks to Anton van
  Straaten). The ContentTransformer module replaces Gitit.Convert. It
  defines a number of single-purpose combinators that can be combined to
  yield various kinds of content conversions. These are used to define
  showPage, preview, showHighlightedSource, and other handlers that used
  to be defined in Gitit.hs.

* Verify in delete POST requests that filetodelete parameter matches
  page.

* Fixed revert when called from diff pages. Revert now reverts to the
  older of the two revisions being compared.

* Revamped auto-merging: user must now verify an edited page after
  a merge, even if there were no conflicts.

* Fixed Content-Disposition header on export so that filenames have
  proper extensions.

* Updated for happstack-server-0.3.3.  Since this version of happstack
  supports UTF-8, gitit's old manual decoding and encoding were removed.

* Use fileServeStrict instead of fileServe.  Resolves Issue #57.

* 'limit' is no longer used in search.  The way it worked before was
  confusing, since it limited total matches (usually to just a few files)
  rather than limiting the number of matches in each file.

* rdgreen's cautious-file library is now used to write the gitit-users
  file. This makes it less likely that the file will be corrupted on
  a power outage or hardware failure.

* Redirects set properly after account creation.  If users go from
  the Login form to the Register form, they are no longer redirected
  back to the Login form after creating an account.

* indexPage now uses filestore's new 'directory' function. It shows one
  directory at a time. Subdirectories link to further index pages. This
  improves on the old javascript folding interface, which did not preserve
  state.  (Thanks to Thomas Hartman for suggestions.)

* URLs of the form /a/b/ are now equivalent to /_index/a/b.

* Improvements and bug fixes to deleting. Deleting a non-page now works.
  You get a nice informative message if you try to delete a nonexistent
  page or file.

* Page names containing "..", "?", or "*", and '_' at beginning are
  disallowed. Page names may now contain periods.

* The "Permanent link" link has been removed. It relied on the sha1
  parameter always being set, but we've changed that for performance
  reasons.

* Gitit can now be proxied to a subdirectory path. Thanks to Henry Laxen
  for the idea and patches. See README for instructions.

* Performance improvements (mostly due to Gwern Branwen):  Pages can be
  compressed (configurable); unneeded filestore calls removed; cache-control:
  max-age used.

* Moved sidebar to end of HTML to make things easier for screen readers.

* Moved search box and go box to templates.

* Yahoo YUI CSS framework is now used for better consistency across browsers.
  CSS cleaned up.  Icons for page types removed.

* Fixed handling of 'forUser' parameter in 'recent activity'.

* Made default maxUploadSize 10 Mb.

* Renamed AppState -> GititState.

Version 0.5.3 released 1 Feb 2009

* Fixed bug which caused jsMath not to load.

Version 0.5.2 released 1 Feb 2009

* Fixed cookie problem caused by empty value fields.

Version 0.5.1 released 1 Feb 2009

* Major code reorganization, making gitit more modular.

* Gitit can now optionally be built using Happstack instead of HAppS
  (just use -fhappstack when cabal installing).

* Fixed bug with directories that had the same names as pages.

* Added code from HAppS-Extra to fix cookie parsing problems.

* New command-line options for --port, --debug.

* New debug feature prints the date, the raw request, and
  the processed request data to standard output on each request.

* Files with ".page" extension can no longer be uploaded.

* Apostrophes and quotation marks now allowed in page names.
