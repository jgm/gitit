Version 0.6.1 released ? ??? 2009

When upgrading, be sure to delete template.html and the static directory so
that these will be replaced by the newest versions.  Or, if you have customized
these, merge the changes into your customized versions.  If your wiki contains
discuss pages of the form `foo:discuss.page`, rename them to `@foo.page`.

Summary of main changes:

* Added support for plugins -- dynamically loaded Haskell programs that
  transform pages. See the haddock documentation for Gitit.Interface for
  plugin documentation. The plugins directory contains several sample
  plugins.

* Gitit's configuration file is now a text file with key-value pairs,
  rather than a Haskell file.  The default configuration file
  (which can be printed using `gitit --print-default-config`
  contains comments that document all of the options.

* Pages may now be written in (limited dialects of) LaTeX or HTML,
  as well as markdown and reStructuredText.  The default format
  is determined by a configuration option, but can be overridden
  on a per-page basis using metadata (see below).  The default
  Front Page and Help page are created in the default format specified
  by the configuration file. In addition, syntax help is now displayed
  to the left of the editing box when a page is being edited.

* Pages may be written in literate Haskell, using either bird
  style with markdown or reStructuredText, or LaTeX style with
  LaTeX.  Literate Haskell can be made the default or specified on
  a per-page basis.

* Gitit now exports a library, Network.Gitit, that makes it easy for
  any happstack application to embed a gitit wiki.

* HTPP authentication is now supported as an alternative to gitit's
  form-based authentication.

* Gitit's form-based authentication now includes a "password reset"
  email.  Slightly modified from a patch from Henry Laxen.

* The naming scheme for discussion pages has changed: the discussion
  page for foo is now @foo, not foo:discuss. Reason: Windows, and
  thus darcs, does not like colons in filenames.

* Improved logging, with configurable verbosity.

* Completely new caching system.  Caching is turned off by default and
  can be enabled by a configuration option.  Complete pages are cached
  on disk and expired when pages are revised through the web interface.
  When pages are modified directly through a VCS, the cache must be
  refreshed manually, either by pressing Ctrl-R while viewing a page,
  or by sending an HTTP request to /_expire/path/to/page, or by using
  the included program expireGititPath. The new system is much faster
  than the old in-memory cache, because it avoids the considerable
  overhead of filestore calls to get the current revision id.

* Major code reorganization and cleanup.  Gitit has been moved under
  the Network namespace. The old WebT handlers are replaced by new ones
  in ServerPartT. 'handle' has been removed; instead, we use happstack's
  routing combinators. Configuration and filestores are now passed
  around in a reader monad, in WikiState. (This also allows different
  wikis to have different configurations.) Most handlers have been
  simplified so that they no longer require Page and Params arguments.
  A new function, 'withInput', is used to avoid the need to pass Params
  between handlers.

* Added Network.Gitit.ContentTransformer module (thanks to Anton van
  Straaten). The ContentTransformer module replaces Gitit.Convert. It
  defines a number of single-purpose combinators that can be combined to
  yield various kinds of content conversions. These are used to define
  showPage, preview, showHighlightedSource, and other handlers that used
  to be defined in Gitit.hs.

* Updated for happstack-server-0.3.3.  Since this version of happstack
  supports UTF-8, gitit's old manual decoding and encoding were removed.

* Redirects set properly after account creation.  If users go from
  the Login form to the Register form, they are no longer redirected
  back to the Login form after creating an account.

* indexPage now uses filestore's new 'directory' function. It shows one
  directory at a time. Subdirectories link to further index pages. This
  improves on the old javascript folding interface, which did not preserve
  state.  (Thanks to Thomas Hartman for suggestions.)

* URLs of the form /a/b/ are now equivalent to /_index/a/b.

* All static content has been moved to the path /_static, so
  it doesn't interfere with user-created `css`, `js`, `img`
  directories.

* Improvements and bug fixes to deleting. Deleting a non-page now works.
  You get a nice informative message if you try to delete a nonexistent
  page or file.

* Page names containing "..", "?", or "*" are disallowed.

* The "Permanent link" link has been removed. It relied on the sha1
  parameter always being set, but we've changed that for performance
  reasons.

* Gitit can now be proxied to a subdirectory path. Thanks to Henry Laxen
  for the idea and patches. See README for instructions.

* Performance improvements (mostly due to Gwern Branwen):  Pages can be
  compressed (configurable); unneeded filestore calls removed; cache-control:
  max-age used.

* Moved sidebar to end of HTML to make things easier for screen readers.

* Yahoo YUI CSS framework is now used for better consistency across browsers.

* Fixed handling of 'forUser' parameter in 'recent activity'.

* Made default maxUploadSize 10 Mb.

* Page names may now contain periods.

Version 0.5.3 released 1 Feb 2009

* Fixed bug which caused jsMath not to load.

Version 0.5.2 released 1 Feb 2009

* Fixed cookie problem caused by empty value fields.

Version 0.5.1 released 1 Feb 2009

* Major code reorganization, making gitit more modular.

* Gitit can now optionally be built using Happstack instead of HAppS
  (just use -fhappstack when cabal installing).

* Fixed bug with directories that had the same names as pages.

* Added code from HAppS-Extra to fix cookie parsing problems.

* New command-line options for --port, --debug.

* New debug feature prints the date, the raw request, and
  the processed request data to standard output on each request.

* Files with ".page" extension can no longer be uploaded.

* Apostrophes and quotation marks now allowed in page names.
